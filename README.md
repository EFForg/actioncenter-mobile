actioncenter-mobile
============

Simple Ionic app for receiving and handling push notifications.

### Getting started

```
npm install
gulp bower
gulp build
```

### Running the server

Spins up a local server to serve the app.

NOTE: the app assumes the presence of various plugins that a browser doesn't have, so some actions, e.g. share buttons etc. will not work and will throw errors

```
gulp watch
```
